# Senior Project Interviews

## Tanner

### Michael (Administrator)
* Students are having difficulty creating appointments online with tutors
* Some sessions that are logged seem to vanish 
* Reports are slowly being implemented. Reports need to be generated for Athletes, Students with Disability services, Students who failed a class or failing, and are attending tutoring.
* Interface for student and tutors is a little much for trying to accomplish basic scheduling and appointments

### Paul/Kevin (Tutors)
* Students are not available to schedule 1-1 appointments with them.
* Student has to meet with Michael (Or differnt admin) to have him set appointment
* When Student signs into kiosks thier courses often do not show up
* Selecting certified courses is very tedious - still shows courses from past years & semesters
* Log view of past/previous appointments does not work - No easy way to read back save and create notes on students
* Being able to view Appointments on calendar is nice already

### Rob (Student)
* List of my current courses do not show up when scheduling
* Therefore cannot schedule appointment directly with tutor on tutor track
* Notification system would be nice to get confirmation alerts
* Sometimes kiosks don’t allow me to sign in


## ABI
### Zachary (Student)
* The contents of this website are readable unlike the current tutor track website.
* It would be nice if the website is scalable with various resolutions and web browsers.
* I think color is very important and fun bright colors can make a page exciting.


### Enrique (Student)
* I have never used the Point Park’s tutor website.
* The page design is consistent, and it is easy to understand and respond.
* A student survey popup after making appointments to get feedback from them would be nice.


### Anil (Student)
* The list of tutors shown on tutor track are not categorized and it is hard to figure out their departments.
* Choosing a specific time for appointment every 30 minutes is great.
* The main page is already nice here, it is clear for students what the next step is.
