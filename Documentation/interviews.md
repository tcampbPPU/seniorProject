# Senior Project Interviews

## Tanner

### Michael (Administrator)
* Students are having difficulty creating appointments online with tutors
* Some sessions that are logged seem to vanish 
* Reports are slowly being implemented. Reports need to be generated for Athletes, Students with Disability services, Students who failed a class or failing, and are attending tutoring.
* Interface for student and tutors is a little much for trying to accomplish basic scheduling and appointments

### Paul/Kevin (Tutors)
* Students are not available to schedule 1-1 appointments with them.
* Student has to meet with Michael (Or differnt admin) to have him set appointment
* When Student signs into kiosks thier courses often do not show up
* Selecting certified courses is very tedious - still shows courses from past years & semesters
* Log view of past/previous appointments does not work - No easy way to read back save and create notes on students
* Being able to view Appointments on calendar is nice already

### Rob (Student)
* List of my current courses do not show up when scheduling
* Therefore cannot schedule appointment directly with tutor on tutor track
* Notification system would be nice to get confirmation alerts
* Sometimes kiosks donâ€™t allow me to sign in


## ABI
### Zachary (Student)
* The contents of this website are readable unlike the current tutor track website.
* It would be nice if the website is scalable with various resolutions and web browsers.
* I think color is very important and fun bright colors can make a page exciting.


### Enrique (Student)
* I have never used the Point Parkâ€™s tutor website.
* The page design is consistent, and it is easy to understand and respond.
* A student survey popup after making appointments to get feedback from them would be nice.


### Anil (Student)
* The list of tutors shown on tutor track are not categorized and it is hard to figure out their departments.
* Choosing a specific time for appointment every 30 minutes is great.
* The main page is already nice here, it is clear for students what the next step is.

### Tim (Student)
* Has not heard of or used Point Park's tutor website up until our meeting.
* âButtons that do not function, lots of white space, and overall poor user experience.
* Would like to be able to quickly view available tutors and time slots in a few steps as possible
* Be able to give feedback from the appointment with a tutor
â*Be able to reschedule
* Site should be secure as it will process user/password information

### Maish (Student)
* Has not heard of or used Point Park's tutor website and would not know how to find it other than searching Point Park' main website. However, student is aware of tutoring services offered at the Center for Student Success.
* Poor user experience with TutorTrac, unresponsive buttons, not appealing, lots of white space, and lack of navigation ability.
* Would like a site that functions as it should be with responsive buttons, not confusing, no redundancy.
* Add pictures that are appealing to the user/student. Like cartoon, books, students, tutors for example
* Add a help feature in case a user needs help with a certain feature of the website. Or even a chat feature that a user can interact with support staff for the website.

### Sam (Student)
* Also has not heard of TutorTrac, Point Park' Tutor site, until mentioning it on our meeting.
* Would not know how to reach the website if they needed help finding a tutor. Alternative would be to search Point Park main website
* Suggested to add tutor bio that shows their courses of expertise
* Suggested a link within Schoology that can take you directly to the tutor scheduling website.
* Should be able to view a calendar of availability
