### Michael (Administrator)
* Students are having difficulty creating appointments online with tutors

* Interface for student and tutors is a little much for trying to accomplish basic scheduling and appointments

### Paul/Kevin (Tutors)
* Students are not available to schedule 1-1 appointments with them.
* Student has to meet with Michael (Or differnt admin) to have him set appointment
* Went Student signs into iPad There courses often do not show up

* Log view of past/previous appointments does not work - No easy way to read back save and create notes on students
* Being able to view Appointments on calendar is nice already

### Rob (Student)

* Therefore cannot schedule appointment directly with tutor on tutor track
* Notification system would be nice to get confirmation alerts
