# Senior Project Interviews

## Tanner

### Michael (Administrator)
* Students are having difficulty creating appointments online with tutors
* Some sessions that are logged seem to vanish 
* Reports are slowly being implemented. Reports need to be generated for Athletes, Students with Disability services, Students who failed a class or failing, and are attending tutoring.
* Interface for student and tutors is a little much for trying to accomplish basic scheduling and appointments

### Paul/Kevin (Tutors)
* Students are not available to schedule 1-1 appointments with them.
* Student has to meet with Michael (Or differnt admin) to have him set appointment
* Went Student signs into iPad There courses often do not show up
* Selecting certified courses is very tedious - still shows courses from past years & semesters
* Log view of past/previous appointments does not work - No easy way to read back save and create notes on students
* Being able to view Appointments on calendar is nice already

### Rob (Student)
* List of my current courses do not show up when scheduling
* Therefore cannot schedule appointment directly with tutor on tutor track
* Notification system would be nice to get confirmation alerts
* Sometimes kiosks donâ€™t allow me to sign in
