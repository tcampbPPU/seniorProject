### Michael (Administrator)
* Scheduling appointments is still the biggest issue the CSS in facing regarding tutoring
* CSS needs to find way to track/monitor:
    - Student Athletes
    - Student that required disability resources and services
    - Students that are failing and/or behind in class, path to graduation
*  Administration Access needs to be added into the program
    - Easy way to add new tutors
    - Monitor appointment notes and scheduling
* Create Reports
    - Be able to show weekly reports of students that came to tutoring
* Email confirm would be great in addition to sms notifications
* Analytical Data
    - Provide peak appointment hours
    - If course have a stronger tutoring requirement then others
* When giving students option to cancel appointments have some time rule (24 hours)
* Need way of monitoring students that come in without an appointment (Drop in students)

### Sean (Tutor)
* Based on the current system would like an easier way to create schedule and select my courses I can tutor in.
* Be able to view a listing of my daily appointments.
* Notifications would be nice, so I can be alerted once my availably has changed


### Nina (Tutor)
* Most of the students now, if not all are drop-ins
    - One due to the fact the current system does’t allow for them to schedule.
    - Most students like the connivence of being able to drop-in
* Need some type of way to have those students (drop-ins) be monitored and added to my schedule so it doesn’t appear to the students that are scheduling online  I am still available


### Nick (Tutor)
* If I know I will be here weekly, option to scheduling the reoccurring appointments for me
* Receive some notification reminder that appointment is coming up
* Have my list of of courses to find tutor in be pre-populated
